                        If you have an item that needs repair, access our @Html.ActionLink("Create listing", "Create", "Jobs") page, where you can
                        list the job you need completed.  A worker may accept your repair.

                <p>You'll be able to check on your job, and see if it's been claimed, activated, or completed.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Claimed: A repair memeber has chosen to take up your repair. It has been added to their Job Queue.</li>
                    <li>Activated: Our repair memeber has completed other jobs, and your is next in line or underway.</li>
                    <li>Completed: Your repair has been completed and marked as such by our repair member.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Once your job is completed, you have no further responsibility. In fact, you can freely @Html.ActionLink("check on the status", "Index", "Jobs") of all repairs,
                    and see which repair members are taking them on.

                <h4>How To Become a Repair Memeber</h4>
                <p>
                    To become a repair member, you'll need to create an @Html.ActionLink("Account", "Register", "Account") and register as a @Html.ActionLink("Workers", "Create", "Workers").
                    To create an account, you won't need to include your name, but to register as a worker, we'll need your first and last name, which will be freely visible.
                </p>
                <p>Once you're a repair member, you'll have access to the @Html.ActionLink("Listings page", "Index", "Jobs"), where you can see a list of jobs, and claim jobs to add to your @Html.ActionLink("Queue", "Index", "Workers").</p>
